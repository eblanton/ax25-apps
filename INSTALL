Installation Instructions for AX.25 Tools
=========================================

To make this library you will need the following:
        glibc2.1
        A Modern kernel
        libtool
        libax25 0.0.5 or better

To build it you type:
        ./configure
        make
        make install

By default, it will install the files in /usr/local.  To change this
so that binaries go in  /usr and the conf files go in /etc
type 'make install --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var'

To install the example configuration files type
	make installconf
